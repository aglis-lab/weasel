/*
The class responsible for storing the AST should provide the following capabilities:
1. AST Representation: It should represent the AST structure using appropriate data structures, such as nodes, edges, or parent-child relationships.
2. AST Manipulation: It should provide methods for manipulating the AST, such as adding, removing, or modifying nodes and connections.
3. AST Traversal: It should provide mechanisms for traversing the AST, allowing other components to visit and process each node in the tree.
4. AST Access: It should provide controlled access to the AST, ensuring that modifications or traversals are performed in a consistent and synchronized manner.
5. AST Serialization: It may provide methods for serializing the AST into a format that can be stored or transmitted, such as JSON or XML.
